# HealthcheckClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Generate environment files

Run `ng generate environments` to create the `environment.ts` and `environment.development.ts` files. It also updates the `angular.json` file to use the environment file corresponding to the selected build type.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### The dry run switch

Add the `--dry-run` switch to prevent the CLI from making any changes to the file system. Useful for seeing what a command does without creating or modifying files. Example: `ng generate component component-name --dry-run`

###### Note: The `--dry-run` switch can be used with any Angular CLI command and is not limited to `ng generate component`.

#### Skipping the spec.ts file

Add the `--skip-tests` switch to prevent the creation of the `spec.ts` file. Example: `ng generate component component-name --skip-tests`

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Installing Angular Material

Run `ng add @angular/material` or include the version number like `ng add @angular/material@17.0.3`.

## Replacing CSS with Sass

Run `ng add schematics-scss-migrate` to automatically migrate from CSS to SCSS.
